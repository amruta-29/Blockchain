1] What is your understanding about Block-chain?
-> Block-chain is a technology used to eradicate loopholes with the help of 
Distributed Database and Cryptography where information is 
verifiable,tamper-proof,Unchangeable,Immutable.

2] What is the core problem block-chain trying to solve?
-> Block-chain is trying to solve the problem related to the basic internet
a)Authenticity
b)Security
c)Need of Powerful third party for trust

3] What are the features that the block-chain will give you?
-> a)Verifiability
b)Unchangeable
c)Tamper-proof
d)Immutable

4] What are all the things the block contains?
->A block contain four major things:-
a)Block Number
b)Transaction Record
c)Previous Block Signature
d)Mining Key

5] How is the verifiability of blockchain can be achieved?
-> Verifiability of bock-chain can be achieved by examining the end result of a particular block i.e. an hash is been generated which is passed on to the next block say block-2 and so on the process goes on,hence the current block's hash key will be generated by using current input+previous block's hash key.After every computation the hash keys are compared within the distributed database and as distributed database contains same data over different places will too give the same hash keys.If all systems outputs the same keys then they are successfully verified else there is change in the data.
